# pso-vessel-design-matlab
This project focuses on utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a bio-inspired algorithm, to solve the complex problem of vessel design optimization. The goal is to enhance the design efficiency and performance of marine vessels by optimizing key parameters such as hull shape, weight distribution, and propulsion systems.
